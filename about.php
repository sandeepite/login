                                    That’s exactly what video production company LessFilms accomplishes on its site using witty copy and the image of a large, tatted-up wrestler. (Yes, a wrestler.) Although the wrestler dude and the funny headlines have nothing to do with LessFilms' business model or product, they show off the founders’ sense of humor and give the brand a personality. </li>

                                <li class="ui-state-default">Have a cool story about how your product or service was helps change lives? Put it on your 'About Us' page. Good stories humanize your brand and provide context and meaning for your product. What’s more, good stories are sticky -- which means people are more likely to connect with them and pass them on.</li>
